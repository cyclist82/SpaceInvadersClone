# SpaceInvadersClone Project Week 3 Java Fall 2018

Small Java FX Game created after 2 weeks of intense Java training with AWAcademy 

This Project was created after 2 weeks of intensive training at the Java Fall 2018 Program of [AWAcademy](https://www.awacademy.de) by [Academic Work](https://www.academicwork.de). My aim was to train the basics of Java programming and to create a game that has the feeling of a early 90s arcade game.

The Game fullscreen resolution is by default set to 1920x1080px. This can easily be changed in the Main class. The second theme won't look good in this version, as I changed the graphics in this version to be sure to avoid any copyright issues.

Have fun playing.
