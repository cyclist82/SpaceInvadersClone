# SpaceInvadersClone Project Week 3 Java Fall 2018

Small Java FX Game created after 2 weeks of intense Java training with AWAcademy 

This Project was created after 2 weeks of intensive training at the Java Fall 2018 Program of [AWAcademy](https://www.awacademy.de) by [Academic Work](https://www.academicwork.de). My aim was to train the basics of Java programming and to create a game that has the feeling of an early 90s arcade game. 

I learned a lot about input handling and created and implemented some collision detection and movement control. The collision detection on a round object was very interesting, as I could use the sentence of the pythagoras to calculate the distance between the laser and a round object. 

The Game fullscreen resolution is by default set to 1920x1080px. This can easily be changed in the Main class in the 2 final variables "WIDTH" and "HEIGTH". The second theme won't look good in this version, as I changed the graphics in this version to be sure to avoid any copyright issues.

Have fun playing.
